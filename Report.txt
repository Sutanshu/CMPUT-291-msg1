It starts off by listing products, from which the user is able to select the pid of one of the products from the presented options. From there, the user can either write a review, list all reviews of the chosen product, or list all actives sales associated to the chosen product.

ValueErrors and invalid input are rigorously handled by the application to ensure that the user does not enter any incorrect input that cannot be processed under the given conditions.
